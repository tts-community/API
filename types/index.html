                <p>Type refers to the type of information being used. You do not need to declare a type in Lua, but in this API you will see them indicated. This is only so you know what kind of information is required in a given variable/parameter. This API utilizes the following types.</p>

<p>You will also see tags for Color, Vector, and Function. See below for more info.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For more information on a type, you can read below or refer to the relevant <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.2">Lua documentation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="special-standards">Special Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#special-standards" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Some types need to be used in specific ways. For Color and Vector, they are Tables that are used often in Tabletop Simulator. They represent Vectors and Colors, and their contents must be formatted a certain way to be utilized correctly.</p>
<p>For Functions, they are used when a delay is required within a running script that have specific requirements.</p>
<h3 id="color">Color<a class="headerlink" href="#color" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><span class="tag col"></span> Color is a type of Table that is used to define RGB values for tinting.</p>
<h4 id="keys">Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#keys" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>The Table will contain the keys <code class="codehilite">r</code>, <code class="codehilite">g</code>, <code class="codehilite">b</code>, <code class="codehilite">a</code> and/or <code class="codehilite">1</code>, <code class="codehilite">2</code>, <code class="codehilite">3</code>, <code class="codehilite">4</code>. The letter and numeric keys are duplicates of each other, and each represents a color or transparency.</p>

<p>As an example, an Object with a white color tint would return this table:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div></p>
<p>Notice it does not contain the <code class="codehilite">a</code> or <code class="codehilite">4</code> keys. This is because currently only scripted buttons and scripted inputs utilize the alpha channel (transparency).</p>
<h4 id="mixed-keys">Mixed Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#mixed-keys" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Only one type of key, number or letter, is required. If both a are present in a Table, the numeric key is ignored and only the <strong>letter key</strong> is used.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">--Valid Table for red</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1">--Valid Table for blue</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1">--This Table would be red.</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h4 id="value">Value<a class="headerlink" href="#value" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Values are between 0 and 1 for each key. If you are using RGB color that is in 0-255, you can use simple math to convert to the proper value.
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">--To display a color that is r=50, b=83, g=199</span>
<span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">setColorTint</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">83</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">199</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">})</span>
</pre></div></p>
<h4 id="strings">Strings<a class="headerlink" href="#strings" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>You are also able to use a String in place of a color table. Using a <a href="../player-color/">Player Color</a> will automatically fill in that value. It works with any of the 12 color names, as they are written on the <a href="../player-color/">Player Color</a> page.</p>
<p>Example: <code class="codehilite">printToAll(&quot;Test&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;)</code></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="vector">Vector<a class="headerlink" href="#vector" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><span class="tag vec"></span> Vector is a type of Object with x, y, and z coordinates that is used to define a position, rotation or direction.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="../vector/">Vector</a> class to manipulate vectors.</p>
<p>Example: <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">target</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Vector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Vector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span><span class="n">normalized</span><span class="p">()</span></code></p>
<h4 id="keys_1">Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#keys_1" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>The Table will contain the keys <code class="codehilite">x</code>, <code class="codehilite">y</code>, <code class="codehilite">z</code> and/or <code class="codehilite">1</code>, <code class="codehilite">2</code>, <code class="codehilite">3</code>. The letter and numeric keys are equivalent.</p>

<p>As an example, An Object at coordinate X=5, Y=2, Z=-1 would return this <a href="../vector/"><code class="codehilite">Vector</code></a>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div></p>
<h4 id="mixed-keys_1">Mixed Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#mixed-keys_1" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Before <a href="../vector/"><code class="codehilite">Vector</code></a> was introduced, coordinate tables contained separate values under 1, 2, 3 and x, y, z keys, with letter keys taking precedence when they were different. This is no longer the case, and using letter and numerical keys is equivalent. However, when iterating over Vector components you have to use <code class="codehilite">pairs</code> and only letter keys will be read there.</p>
<h4 id="value-range">Value Range<a class="headerlink" href="#value-range" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>The range of values depend on the type of Vector you are using.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="function">Function<a class="headerlink" href="#function" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><span class="tag fun"></span> A function is a section of code that can be run when triggered. In Lua, you are able to pass (use as a parameter) functions. Some elements in Tabletop Simulator can be passed functions to perform some action with, like triggering it after a delay.</p>
<h4 id="usage">Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>To pass a function, first you must create the function. There are multiple ways to do this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">--Create it on-the-fly</span>
<span class="kr">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Like This&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">end</span>

<span class="c1">--Create it with a variable name</span>
<span class="n">anyFuncName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kr">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Like This&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">end</span>

<span class="c1">--Create it with a variable name that can also be passed parameters</span>
<span class="kr">function</span> <span class="nf">anyFuncName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">printString</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">printString</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kr">end</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>You need to pass a function, not a result of a function. So this <strong>will not</strong> work:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Wait</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frames</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Ding&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">80</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
Instead, make the print the result of a function running:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Wait</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frames</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Ding&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">end</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">80</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div></p>
</div>
<hr />
<h4 id="example">Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>As an example, here is <a href="../wait/#frames">Wait.frames(...)</a> used 3 times. It waits a set number of frames and then activates a given function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">function</span> <span class="nf">onLoad</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="c1">--Built-in functions with parameters can be called directly</span>
    <span class="c1">--This is done by wrapping the function within `function()` and `end`</span>
    <span class="n">Wait</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frames</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;One&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">end</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1">--You can also call custom functions you have made yourself</span>
    <span class="c1">--Pass them any parameters you wish</span>
    <span class="n">Wait</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frames</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">sayTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Two&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">end</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">120</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1">--If you aren&#39;t passing any parameters to the function, you can shorten it</span>
    <span class="n">Wait</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frames</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sayThree</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">180</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kr">end</span>

<span class="c1">--Has its parameter passed to it</span>
<span class="kr">function</span> <span class="nf">sayTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">end</span>

<span class="c1">--Does not have any parameters passed to it</span>

<h4 id="lambda-style-expressions">Lambda-Style Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#lambda-style-expressions" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>You are able to replace <code class="codehilite">function()</code> and <code class="codehilite">end</code> with <code class="codehilite">||</code>, allowing for much shorter functions.</p>
<h5 id="important-tips">Important Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#important-tips" title="Permanent link"> </a></h5>
<p>You create a <code class="codehilite">|</code>, on a standard keyboard, by holding shift and pressing the key above enter (backslash).</p>
<p><code class="codehilite">||</code> only work for one line. So if you intend to use a multi-line function, lambda-style will not be an option.</p>
<p>When using <code class="codehilite">||</code> for a conditional function with <code class="codehilite">Wait.condition(returnFunc, conditionalFunc)</code>, you do not need to include return.</p>
<p>If a parameter is passed to the return function, like with <code class="codehilite">callback_function</code> from <code class="codehilite">spawnObject(...)</code>, you can put a variable between the <code class="codehilite">||</code> characters to represent it. See the next section for an example.</p>
<h5 id="lambda-style-example">Lambda-Style Example<a class="headerlink" href="#lambda-style-example" title="Permanent link"> </a></h5>
<p>Without Lambda-style:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">function</span> <span class="nf">onLoad</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="c1">--Spawn a deck with a callback function that triggers once deck spawns</span>
