                <p>UI, a static global class AND an Object class. It is the method to interact with custom UI elements. It allows you to read/write attributes of elements defined in the XML of the UI. It also allows you to receive information from various inputs (like buttons) on-screen and on objects.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>This class allows for the <strong>manipulation</strong> of UI <strong>at runtime</strong>. It does <strong>NOT</strong> modify or fetch <strong>the original XML</strong> in the editor, but rather what is displayed as it continues to run during a game. Just like with Lua, you can only get/set dynamic values during runtime. You can use <a href="../event/#onsave">onSave</a> and <a href="../event/#onload">onLoad</a> to record any data you want to persist through save/load/undo.</p>
<p>For more information on how to build UI elements within XML, view the <a href="introUI/">UI API</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="global-and-object">Global and Object<a class="headerlink" href="#global-and-object" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>UI can either be placed on the screen by using the <strong>Global UI</strong> or placed on an Object using <strong>Object UI</strong>. Depending on which you are using, these commands are used differently.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Example of calling a function targeted at the Global UI:
    UI.getAttributes(id)
Example of calling a function targeted at an Object UI:
    object.UI.getAttributes(id)
</pre></div>


<h2 id="inputs">Inputs<a class="headerlink" href="#inputs" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p><a href="inputelements/">Input Elements</a> are able to trigger a function. By default, Global UI will trigger a function in Global and Object UI will trigger a function in the Object's script.  To change the target script for an input, <a href="inputelements/#targeting-triggers">view more details here</a>.</p>
<p>When creating the input element in XML, you will select the name of the function it activates. Regardless of its name, it always will pass parameters</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">functionName(player, value, id)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../types/"><span class="tag pla"></span></a> <strong>player</strong>: A direct Player reference to the person that triggered the input.</li>
<li><a href="../types/"><span class="tag var"></span></a> <strong>value</strong>: The value sent by the input. A numeric value or a string, generally.<ul>
