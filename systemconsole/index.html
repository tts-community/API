                  <h1>System Console</h1>
                
                <p>The system console gives you a direct way to interact with Tabletop Simulator's settings.  It can be used to automate repetitive actions, and customise your TTS experience.</p>
<h2 id="controls">Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#controls" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The console accepts basic text input.  Additionally, you may hit <code class="codehilite">up arrow</code> and <code class="codehilite">down arrow</code> to cycle back and forth through the command history, and <code class="codehilite">tab</code> to autocomplete your current command (if more than one command is possible from your current prefix then hit it a couple of times to list all matching commands).  Hitting the <code class="codehilite">`</code> key will activate the console.  Hitting it again will type the character; if you would rather it deactivated the console input as well as activating it, then you can make it do that by entering this command: <code class="codehilite">+console_hotkey_lock</code></p>
<h2 id="commands-variables">Commands &amp; Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#commands-variables" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>You interact with the system console by typing commands into it.  When you hit enter the command will be perform its action, and then output its results to the console.</p>
<p>There is a subset of the commands which have an additional property; these are called <code class="codehilite">variables</code>, and each one stores a value (in addition to behaving like regular commands).  Typically these are used for the settings which govern TTS behaviour.  For example, the <code class="codehilite">color</code> command is a variable; it holds the seat color you currently occupy.  Typing it without any parameters will make it output its current value, while typing it with a parameter will let you set it; you could type <code class="codehilite">color red</code> to switch to the red seat, for instance.  You may also create your own variables with the <code class="codehilite">store_number</code>, <code class="codehilite">store_toggle</code>, and <code class="codehilite">store_text</code> commands (or if you are familiar with programming, their aliases: <code class="codehilite">float</code>, <code class="codehilite">bool</code>, and <code class="codehilite">string</code>); these are especially useful when writing scripts.</p>
<p>A lot of variables are toggles: they can be either <code class="codehilite">OFF</code> or <code class="codehilite">ON</code>.  For these you can set them in an additional way; by prefixing with <code class="codehilite">+</code>, <code class="codehilite">-</code>, or <code class="codehilite">!</code>.  <code class="codehilite">+</code> will turn it on, <code class="codehilite">-</code> will turn it off, and <code class="codehilite">!</code> will toggle it, changing it to the opposite of its current value.  For example: <code class="codehilite">+measure_in_metric</code> will set <code class="codehilite">measure_in_metric</code> to <code class="codehilite">ON</code>, and <code class="codehilite"><span class="sx">!measure_logging</span></code> when <code class="codehilite">measure_logging</code> is <code class="codehilite">ON</code> will set it to <code class="codehilite">OFF</code> (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>Note that some variables are <code class="codehilite">persistent</code> - this means that they will remember their value even after you close the game.</p>
<p>There are three commands which are extremely valuable when getting to know the console, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">commands</code> - Lists all non-variable commands.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">variables</code> - Lists all variable commands and their current values.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">help</code> - Lists all commands, with a description of what they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may specify a prefix when using these to have them filter to only commands which begin with it; for example you could type <code class="codehilite">variables spectator</code> to see the value of all commands which deal with the spectator window.
Additionally, if you ask for <code class="codehilite">help</code> on a specific command it will give you a detailed description of how to use it.</p>
<p>You may insert variables into commands by enclosing them in <code class="codehilite">{</code> and <code class="codehilite">}</code>.  For example, typing <code class="codehilite">hovered</code> will display the GUID of the object your pointer is hovering over; <code class="codehilite">spectator_camera_target {hovered}</code> will set the spectator camera target with it.</p>
<p>If you start a command with the <code class="codehilite">@</code> symbol then it will be silenced; it will not output anything to the console.</p>
<h2 id="scripts">Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#scripts" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The <code class="codehilite">exec</code> command will execute a series of commands separated either by <code class="codehilite">;</code> or by being on separate lines.  Alternatively, you may use the <code class="codehilite">-v</code> parameter to execute a text variable as a script.  For example, <code class="codehilite">exec -v bootexec</code> will execute the commands in the <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code> variable (there is also a <code class="codehilite">run</code> alias, which performs <code class="codehilite">exec -v</code>, so <code class="codehilite">run bootexec</code> will do the same thing).  You may also pass <code class="codehilite">exec</code> a <code class="codehilite">-q</code> parameter to make it execute in quiet mode (commands being executed are not echoed to the console, but their output is).</p>
<p>There are two special variables: <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code> and <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code>; these are text variables which load the contents of those two files - <code class="codehilite">autoexec.cfg</code> and <code class="codehilite">bootexec.cfg</code>, respectively - in your TTS user folder (typically <code class="codehilite">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator</code>).</p>
<p><code class="codehilite">autoexec</code> will be executed every time you arrive at the main menu in TTS, while <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code> is only executed once, when TTS first starts up.  Note that the game resets every time you go back to the main menu, so if you want to affect any settings / add bindings / etc you need to do it in <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code></p>
<p>Example <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Host a game for 8 players using default server name and password</span>
host_game <span class="m">8</span>

<span class="c1"># Load game on row 4 slot 5</span>
ui_games_click <span class="m">4</span> <span class="m">5</span>

<span class="c1"># Switch to system console</span>
chat_tab_system

<span class="c1"># Activate spectator window</span>
+spectator_window
</pre></div></p>
<p>Example <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Make easier to type versions of spectator_camera_ commands.</span>
<span class="c1"># i.e. cam_load instead of spectator_camera_load</span>
<span class="nb">alias</span> cam_* spectator_camera_*

<span class="c1"># Set some settings</span>
+cam_stay_upright
-spectator_show_ui

<span class="c1"># make right control have camera follow player while held</span>
<span class="c1"># @ makes it not output to console</span>
<span class="nb">bind</span> +right_control @+cam_follow_player
<span class="nb">bind</span> -right_control @-cam_follow_player

<span class="c1"># make semicolon look at object under pointer</span>
<span class="c1"># need to add additional { } so hovered isn&#39;t evaluated immediately</span>
<span class="nb">bind</span> semicolon cam_look_at <span class="o">{{</span>hovered<span class="o">}}</span>

<span class="c1"># make period toggle object tracking, and comma set tracked object</span>
<span class="nb">bind</span> period !cam_tracking
<span class="nb">bind</span> comma cam_target <span class="o">{{</span>hovered<span class="o">}}</span>

<span class="c1"># make right shift cycle through first 3 camera positions</span>
<span class="nb">alias</span> next_camera add cam_load_zero <span class="m">1</span> <span class="m">3</span>
<span class="nb">bind</span> right_shift next_camera

<span class="c1"># make some buttons to load specific camera positions</span>
ui_button <span class="m">1</span> <span class="m">600</span>   <span class="m">0</span> cam_load <span class="m">1</span>

ui_button <span class="m">3</span> <span class="m">600</span> -60 cam_load <span class="m">3</span>
</pre></div></p>
<h3 id="special-characters">Special characters<a class="headerlink" href="#special-characters" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">@</code> - Behaves as it does normally; prefix it to a command to silence that command.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">@@</code> - Two <code class="codehilite">@</code> in a row silences the remainder of the script; each command will behave as if it had a <code class="codehilite">@</code> before it.  <code class="codehilite">@@</code> again will disable this effect.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">#</code> - At the start of a line is used for comments; the line will be ignored.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">:</code> - At the start of a line is used to specify a label, which may be skipped to with the <code class="codehilite">skip</code> command.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">{</code> and <code class="codehilite">}</code> - If you surround a variable with these then it will be evaluated during the script execution; you may add additional braces to delay evaluation.  Whenever a command being executed has braces in its parameters it will either strip one layer off (if there is more than one), or evaluate the enclosed variable (if there is only one layer); e.g. <code class="codehilite"><span class="cp">{{</span><span class="nv">hovered</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"></span></code> will become <code class="codehilite">{hovered}</code>, whereas <code class="codehilite">{hovered}</code> will become the component currently under the mouse pointer.  You can see this used in the above <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>.  Another example; say you wanted a binding which could add a binding to another key.  We add this line to the <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">bind</span> right_shift <span class="nb">bind</span> right_control spectator_camera_target <span class="o">{{{</span>hovered<span class="o">}}}</span>
</pre></div>
When the <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code> is executed and the first <code class="codehilite">bind</code> is called, the first layer of braces will be removed, so the command bound to right shift will be:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">bind</span> right_control spectator_camera_target <span class="o">{{</span>hovered<span class="o">}}</span>
</pre></div>
Then when you hit right shift, it will resolve so that the command bound to right control is:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>spectator_camera_target <span class="o">{</span>hovered<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
Now when you hit right control while hovering over the object, the hovered object will be evaulated and passed to <code class="codehilite">spectator_camera_target</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="script-commands">Script commands<a class="headerlink" href="#script-commands" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>The <code class="codehilite">skip</code> command can be used inside a script to jump forward to a label.  It may not be used to jump backwards.  You may give it an optional <code class="codehilite">variable</code> and then further optional <code class="codehilite">comparison</code> and <code class="codehilite">value</code> parameters: if you do it will only skip if the variable is non-zero, or the result of the comparison is true.</p>
<p>The <code class="codehilite">wait</code> command will pause the script for the specified number of seconds.  It will always wait at least one frame, so <code class="codehilite">wait 0</code> will do just that.  This can be useful in <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code> and <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>, as some game systems may take a couple of frames to intialize; if your commands do not appear to work then try putting them at the end of the script, after a <code class="codehilite">wait</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code class="codehilite">exit</code> command will cause the script to stop executing.</p>
<p>Example <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>@@ <span class="c1"># silence script</span>


<span class="c1">## Set up a `private_room` variable to govern whether server is private or public</span>

<h2 id="some-useful-commands">Some useful commands<a class="headerlink" href="#some-useful-commands" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>As noted above, <code class="codehilite">help</code>, <code class="codehilite">commands</code>, and <code class="codehilite">variables</code> will let you find out everything you can do with the system console.  Having said that, here is a selection of some of the more useful commands available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">add</code>, <code class="codehilite">subtract</code>, and <code class="codehilite">multiply</code> will let you do simple arithmetic on a variable.  <code class="codehilite">add</code> is useful for cycling a modal variable (it has an optional third parameter which sets a modulus), while <code class="codehilite">subtract</code> subtracts the variable <em>from</em> the value, so is useful for ping-ponging between two numbers.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">alias</code> is overloaded with several functions:<ul>
<li>Its basic use is to create a new name for another command, while retaining any parameters you type in. Good for making shorter names for commands you use a lot.  Use with <code class="codehilite">store_text</code> and <code class="codehilite">exec</code> to make your own commands from scripts.</li>
<li>It can also be used to attach commands to each value of a toggle variable, which will run when the variable is set to that value.  You can see this in the example script above, with the <code class="codehilite">private_room</code> variable.</li>
<li>Finally, if there are a collection of commands sharing a prefix which you want to make short versions of you can use <code class="codehilite">*</code> to do so (e.g. <code class="codehilite">alias cam_* spectator_camera_*</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">append</code> will append text to a text variable.  If you only provide the variable parameter, without text, it will append the last entered command. This is useful for adding commands to <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>; you can try the command out in the console until you get it correct, before appending it to the script.</li>

<li><code class="codehilite">eval</code> sets a variable by evaluating a formula.  Most arithmetic operators and functions are provided.  You may also refer to vector axes, i.e. <code class="codehilite">examine_rotation.y</code>.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">find</code> finds a component on the table.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">grabbed</code>, <code class="codehilite">hovered</code> output the GUID of the component you are interacting with.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">highlight</code> a component.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">host_game</code> creates a table; you can specify single player, multiplayer, or hotseat.</li>
