                <p>Lighting, a static global class, is the in-game light of the map. It allows you to modify the lighting of the instance in the same way that the <a href="http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/lighting/">in-game lighting menu</a> does. You call these functions like this: <code class="codehilite">Lighting.apply()</code>.</p>
<p>For more information on lighting in Unity, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightingOverview.html">refer to the Unity documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="member-variables">Member Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#member-variables" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Like <a href="../object/#member-variables">Object member variables</a>, Lighting has its own member variables. They are all numbers, and have specific valid ranges.</p>
