                <p>The static global WebRequest class allows you to interact with the web via get, post and put. This is a more advanced feature that allows you to store/retrieve data to/from an external database.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example Usage:<code class="codehilite"><span class="n">WebRequest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">google</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="err">“</span><span class="n">webRequestCallback</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">)</span></code></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="member-variables">Member Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#member-variables" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Like <a href="../object/#member-variables">Object member variables</a>, WebRequests have their own member variables.</p>
<p>A WebRequest is returned as part of a function, and these member variables are how your access its information.</p>
